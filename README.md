# Intelligent-Security

IIIT Allahabad has recently installed a network of security cameras throughout the campus. The cameras take continuous videos of the surroundings. Each building has at least a guard while the institute has a central security office. The developed application provides following functionality using security cameras:-

a) Detecting incoming and outgoing people and raising an alarm in such cases. This will be especially useful for night-shift guards to get more alert on such alarms.

b) Detecting bags carried by the incoming and outgoing people and raising alarms in such cases

c) Detecting unusual activities like mobs of people gathered around, anomaly detection in crowd, etc.

d) Detecting stray animals like dogs from the camera images and raising alerts so that the guards can take the necessary action.
